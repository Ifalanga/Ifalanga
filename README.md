### Hi there 👋

👨🏼‍🎓 Bsc degree in Computer Science and Informatics at The University of Johannesburg.

🌱 A Software Developer/Engineer in the process

🌱 Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence enthusiastic, I am growing in this field one day at a time.

📝 As an author, I believe that meaningful stories can be told using binary code instead of traditional language, 
I'm fascinated by the simplicity and universality of 0's and 1's, and how they can communicate complex ideas without 
relying on words that can lose meaning over time.
