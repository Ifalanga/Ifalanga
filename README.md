### Hi there I'm Ifalanga Sinthumule 👋

📝 As an author, I believe that meaningful stories can be told using binary code instead of traditional language, 
I'm fascinated by the simplicity and universality of 0's and 1's, and how they can communicate complex ideas without 
relying on words that can lose meaning over time.

👨🏼‍🎓 Bsc degree in Computer Science and Informatics student at The University of Johannesburg.

👨‍💻 A Software Developer/Engineer in the process, I am growing in this field one day at a time

🌱 Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence enthusiastic.

🚀 In the future, I hope to work on projects that have a positive impact on society and help solve real-world problems. I believe that technology can be a force for good, and I'm excited to be a part of that movement.
